            <div class="story-text">
                <p class="opening-line">The arena fell silent as the two warriors took their positions, weapons gleaming in the storm-light.</p>

                <p>Marth moved first, his form a blur of silver and blue as he closed the distance between them in the blink of an eye. The Falchion sang through the air, leaving trails of ethereal light in its wake. Byleth barely had time to raise the Sword of the Creator before the first strike came.</p>

                <div class="action-sequence">
                    <div class="move-description">
                        <h4>Opening Strike - Lightning Lunge</h4>
                        <p>Marth's blade flashed forward with impossible speed, aimed directly at Byleth's exposed side. The crowd gasped as the sword seemed to phase through reality itself.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p><strong>CLANG!</strong> The sound of metal on metal echoed across the arena as Stormbreaker intercepted the blow. Sparks flew in all directions, and the very ground shook from the impact. Byleth's massive frame barely moved, but his eyes widened in surprise at the force behind Marth's attack.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p class="speaker">Byleth:</p>
                    <p class="speech">"Not bad, Marth. But speed alone won't save you from the storm!"</p>
                </div>

                <p>With a roar that shook the foundations of the arena, Byleth swung the Sword of the Creator in a devastating arc. The blade crackled with divine energy, and the air itself seemed to split as the weapon cut through space. Marth barely managed to leap aside, but the shockwave from the missed strike sent him tumbling across the sand.</p>

                <div class="action-sequence">
                    <div class="move-description">
                        <h4>Thunder Strike - Mountain Cleaver</h4>
                        <p>Byleth's axe came down with the force of a falling mountain, creating a crater in the arena floor. The impact sent shockwaves rippling outward, cracking the ancient stone.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Rolling to his feet, Marth wiped blood from his lip and grinned. "Impressive. But you're too slow, Byleth."</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p class="speaker">Marth:</p>
                    <p class="speech">"Let me show you what true speed looks like!"</p>
                </div>

                <p>What happened next defied belief. Marth seemed to multiply, his form splitting into a dozen afterimages as he moved with supernatural speed. Each image struck from a different angle, the Falchion leaving trails of blue light that formed a complex web around Byleth.</p>

                <div class="action-sequence">
                    <div class="move-description">
                        <h4>Phantom Assault - Shadow Dance</h4>
                        <p>Marth's ultimate technique: moving so fast he appears to be in multiple places at once. Each strike is real, each cut potentially fatal.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Byleth roared in frustration, swinging the Sword of the Creator in wide arcs, but each strike found only empty air. The crowd was on their feet, cheering wildly as the two warriors demonstrated skills that seemed to transcend mortal limitations.</p>

                <p>But then, in a moment of perfect timing, Byleth's eyes narrowed. He had been watching, learning, waiting for the right moment. As Marth's final strike came in, Byleth suddenly pivoted, using the momentum of his missed swing to bring the Sword of the Creator around in a devastating counter-attack.</p>
