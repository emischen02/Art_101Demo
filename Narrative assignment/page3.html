            <div class="story-text">
                <p class="opening-line">The arena fell silent as the two warriors took their positions, weapons gleaming in the storm-light.</p>

                <p>Sir Aldric moved first, his form a blur of silver and blue as he closed the distance between them in the blink of an eye. The Moonlight Blade sang through the air, leaving trails of ethereal light in its wake. Thane Ironbeard barely had time to raise Stormbreaker before the first strike came.</p>

                <div class="action-sequence">
                    <img src="images/lightning_lunge.jpg" alt="Lightning Lunge Attack" class="floating-image">
                    <div class="move-description">
                        <h4>Opening Strike - Lightning Lunge</h4>
                        <p>Sir Aldric's blade flashed forward with impossible speed, aimed directly at Thane's exposed side. The crowd gasped as the sword seemed to phase through reality itself.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p><strong>CLANG!</strong> The sound of metal on metal echoed across the arena as Stormbreaker intercepted the blow. Sparks flew in all directions, and the very ground shook from the impact. Thane's massive frame barely moved, but his eyes widened in surprise at the force behind Aldric's attack.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p class="speaker">Thane Ironbeard:</p>
                    <p class="speech">"Not bad, boy. But speed alone won't save you from the storm!"</p>
                </div>

                <p>With a roar that shook the foundations of the arena, Thane swung Stormbreaker in a devastating arc. The axe head crackled with lightning, and the air itself seemed to split as the weapon cut through space. Sir Aldric barely managed to leap aside, but the shockwave from the missed strike sent him tumbling across the sand.</p>

                <div class="action-sequence">
                    <img src="images/thunder_strike.jpg" alt="Thunder Strike Attack" class="floating-image-left">
                    <div class="move-description">
                        <h4>Thunder Strike - Mountain Cleaver</h4>
                        <p>Thane's axe came down with the force of a falling mountain, creating a crater in the arena floor. The impact sent shockwaves rippling outward, cracking the ancient stone.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Rolling to his feet, Sir Aldric wiped blood from his lip and grinned. "Impressive. But you're too slow, old man."</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p class="speaker">Sir Aldric:</p>
                    <p class="speech">"Let me show you what true speed looks like!"</p>
                </div>

                <p>What happened next defied belief. Sir Aldric seemed to multiply, his form splitting into a dozen afterimages as he moved with supernatural speed. Each image struck from a different angle, the Moonlight Blade leaving trails of blue light that formed a complex web around Thane.</p>

                <div class="action-sequence">
                    <img src="images/phantom_assault.jpg" alt="Phantom Assault Technique" class="centered-image">

                    <div class="move-description">
                        <h4>Phantom Assault - Shadow Dance</h4>
                        <p>Sir Aldric's ultimate technique: moving so fast he appears to be in multiple places at once. Each strike is real, each cut potentially fatal.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Thane roared in frustration, swinging Stormbreaker in wide arcs, but each strike found only empty air. The crowd was on their feet, cheering wildly as the two warriors demonstrated skills that seemed to transcend mortal limitations.</p>

                <p>But then, in a moment of perfect timing, Thane's eyes narrowed. He had been watching, learning, waiting for the right moment. As Sir Aldric's final strike came in, Thane suddenly pivoted, using the momentum of his missed swing to bring Stormbreaker around in a devastating counter-attack.</p>
