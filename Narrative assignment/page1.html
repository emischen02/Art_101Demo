                <div class="story-text">
                    <p class="opening-line">The ancient arena stood silent under a blood-red sunset, its weathered stones bearing witness to countless battles of legend.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thunder rumbled in the distance as two figures emerged from opposite ends of the colosseum. The first, a tall warrior clad in silver armor, moved with the grace of a mountain cat. His name was <span class="character-name">Marth</span>, and his reputation for lightning-fast strikes preceded him across the seven kingdoms.</p>

                    <p>From the shadows of the eastern gate emerged his opponent: <span class="character-name">Byleth</span>, a massive figure whose very presence seemed to make the ground tremble. His weathered face bore the scars of a hundred battles, and his eyes burned with the fire of a warrior who had never known defeat.</p>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="speaker">Marth:</p>
                        <p class="speech">"So, the legendary Byleth finally emerges from his mountain fortress. I had heard tales of your strength, but seeing it in person... it's almost disappointing."</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="dialogue">
                        <p class="speaker">Byleth:</p>
                        <p class="speech">"Words are wind, boy. Let your blade speak, if you dare. I've crushed better men than you before breakfast."</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The tension in the air was palpable. Spectators in the upper tiers leaned forward, their breath held in anticipation. Even the birds had ceased their songs, as if nature itself awaited the coming storm of steel and fury.</p>

                    <p>In the royal box, King Valdris III watched with keen interest, his jeweled crown catching the last rays of sunlight. Beside him, the court wizard whispered incantations to ensure the battle would be recorded for posterity.</p>
