            <div class="story-text">
                <p class="opening-line">The weapons master approached, carrying two ornate chests that seemed to pulse with ancient power.</p>

                <p>Marth's eyes gleamed as the first chest opened, revealing the Falchion. The sword seemed to sing as it caught the light, its blade shimmering with an otherworldly blue glow. The hilt was wrapped in silver wire, and the pommel bore the crest of the royal house of Altea.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p class="speaker">Marth:</p>
                    <p class="speech">"Ah, Falchion. I've heard the legends. They say it was forged by the divine dragon Naga herself."</p>
                </div>

                <p>As he grasped the weapon, the blade erupted in brilliant blue light, and the very air around him seemed to shimmer with magical energy. The crowd gasped as runes along the blade's edge began to glow with ancient script.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, Byleth's chest opened with a thunderous boom, revealing the Sword of the Creator. The massive blade was forged from a metal that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it, and the handle was carved from the heartwood of an ancient tree blessed by the goddess.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p class="speaker">Byleth:</p>
                    <p class="speech">"Sword of the Creator... a relic of legend, said to be a gift from the goddess herself. This blade has never known defeat."</p>
                </div>

                <p>As his hands closed around the weapon, divine energy began to gather overhead, and the first drops of rain began to fall. Lightning crackled along the blade's edge, and the ground beneath Byleth's feet began to crack and splinter.</p>

                <p>The weapons master stepped back, his face pale with awe. "Never in my fifty years have I seen such power. These are not mere weapons—they are instruments of destiny."</p>
